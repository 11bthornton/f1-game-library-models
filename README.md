# F1 Game Library Models

I built this library primarily to learn about Rust package management on [crates.io](crates.io) and the various CI/CD tools available for Rust on Github, so the library shouldn't really be used for anything you're needing to really depend upon - I nevertheless hope you find it useful.

This is part of a larger project I have to do some interesting things with the UDP telemetry data the F1 video game series spits out during races or during the menus.

It is based on the [UDP Specification](https://forums.ea.com/blog/f1-games-game-info-hub-en/ea-sports%E2%84%A2-f1%C2%AE25-udp-specification/12187347) for the F1-2025 video game. Previous versions are not supported.

This project defines the data types and various utility methods you might want need. It does not handle parsing.
